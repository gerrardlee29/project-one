-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are blue, and yellow.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Oswald font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Osawld is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
​
-   #### First Time Visitor Goals
​
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the gym.
​
        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the section of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Join Now" Call to action button.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click which section they want to go on the Navbar or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the gym.
​
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
​
        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of the page there is a clean fixed navigation bar, upon clicking each link on the navbar it will target and move to that section of the page.
        2. If the user decides to sign up the first time they visit the website then once they fill out the form at the start of the page and click sign up it stays on the same top section of the page.
        3. Due to the website being of a 1 page scrolling design, when the user gets to the bottom of the page and wants to return to the top they can click the title name on the fixed navbar or just scroll up.
​
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what the people have to say about their experiences at the gym.
    
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us, and Personal Training sections, they will also notice the Yoga/Group Activites section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page the user is told that alternatively they can either contact the gym by phone, or on social media. There are social media icon links that will direct the user to the social media pages.
​
-   #### Returning Visitor Goals
​
    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about what the gym memberships plans and prices are.
​
        1. This is clearly shown as the Main pages title to catch the users attention to join.
        2. Underneath the attention title of the prices there is a call to action button that once clicked pops up a sign up form for the user to sign up to the gym.
​
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the gym with any questions I may have.
​    
        1. The footer contains links to the gyms Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as Youtube.
        2. The footer also contains the phone number and address to the gym,
​
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find out who the fitness trainers are at the gym, and what type of physcial training they specialize in.
        1. The Navbar has a tab for Fitness Trainers, and once clicked then the page will 
        move to and target that setion of the website.
        2. Alternatively, the user can also just scroll down to the section and see the information that way.
        3. Once the user has come to the fitness trainers section of the website there the user can see who the trainers are, and also their professional area of expertise
​
-   #### Frequent User Goals
​
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added group programs.
​
        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.
​
    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if the hours that the gym is open remain the same or if they have changed.
​
        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link
​
    3. As a Frequent User, I want to find social medica links for gym.
        1. At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
        
        
​
### Further Testing
​
-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly. 

​
### Known Bugs
​
-   On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
    -   A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
-   On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.
